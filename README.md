# Leetcode Solutions

Place for me to store my solutions to LeetCode problems.

I'm following a [roadmap](https://neetcode.io/roadmap) from Neetcode for DSA and python. For SQL, I'm following the [Leetcode SQL Study Plan](https://leetcode.com/study-plan/sql/?progress=xc3f2ulc).

Will try to commentate on my solutions as much as possible.

I am using this [VSCode Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=LeetCode.vscode-leetcode) to run my solutions. It downloads the problem and test cases for you, and you can run your solution against the test cases and submit. The problems get downloaded to `~/.leetcode`, which is where I'm pushing this repo from. It might work as is if you clone this repo and run the extension, but I haven't tried it.
